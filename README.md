# ReactJS Calculator

This is a simplified recreation of the Windows 10 Calculator App although this uses only the Standard type. This does not include the Programmer, Scientific types, and etc. This is done using only ReactJS with Bootstrap 4.3.1 as the CSS framework

To run this in your local environment simply run:

    npm start

or if you use yarn:

    yarn start
